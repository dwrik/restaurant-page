# Restaurant-page

This is a simple restaurant homepage which is dynamically rendered using `javascript`. The DOM elements were created using `javascript` but the styling was done using external `css`. This project has been built as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/home) full stack curriculum that am currently undertaking.

The project helped me learn a lot about `ES6 modules`, `webpack` and `npm` in general. These were extensively used in the project.
